# ML_with_Siraj_2
This is the second homework from Machine Learning with Siraj.

I followed the tutorial from Vincent Tatan on how to preprocess the data for machine learning algorithms in sci-kit learn.
I usually have a problem with preprocessing data because I have a hard time visualizing the data and what I want to do with it.
That is why I am very grateful that Vincent created the tutorial.  It can be found at the address below.
